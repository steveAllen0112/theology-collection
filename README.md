"I did it all for the Wiki..."

This repository exists primarily to gain access to the wiki feature of GitHub for its purposes.

The wiki is used to me and my group of friends to collect and link resources on various topics related to theology.

 - Theology Proper
 - Ecclesiology
 - Writings
 - Miracle Reports
 - Lives of the Canonized
 - etc.
